Today I saw a red squirrel scamper up a tree and into a hole.  A pileated woodpecker has been doing a number on that tree for as long as I've visited Hop Brook.  The old white pine is peppered with rectangular boxes - some a dead end, a runway to a wooden wall - and some, gateways to the tree's inner caverns.  The hollowed out nooks show their age - the new with fresh tan woodchips sprinkled on the snow - and the old with a crust of hardened sap, dripping out their openings.  Doors, portals, windows - all could describe what a woodpecker makes here.  A trough for the bird, a home for the squirrel.

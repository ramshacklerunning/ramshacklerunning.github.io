### On Woodpeckers

Fresh chips on the forest floor are your cue to look up.  Maybe at a dead paper birch - dead, but still standing - and quite alive with the life of the forest.  Energy can neither be created nor destroyed - only transitioned to its new form.  The forest epitomizes this phenomenon.
Look up for the pileated's bore - its rectangular lunch box chiseled into the punky wood.  Listen for its call - a cackle unmistakeable once known.

Snow on Earth Day - frozen hands on the phenology loop.  There were cacaphonous sapsuckers playing out their spring ritual.  A turkey vulture took flight from the talus field on the east slope of the hill - I suppose she was nesting in some rocky nook.  On the descent I spotted the burnt-brown blaze of the pileated woodpecker left etched on a red oak.
Standing in the wind I felt myself sway back and forth - not quite dissimilar to the movement of the trees - best seen from up high as on a cliff or tower.  I always felt it was as if the Earth was breathing - the swaying of the trees.  It's easy to forget that they are still just plants and readily moved with a strong gust - as would a blade of grass in the breeze.

Today I saw a red squirrel scamper up a tree and into a hole.  A pileated woodpecker has been doing a number on that tree for as long as I've visited Hop Brook.  The old white pine is peppered with rectangular boxes - some a dead end, a runway to a wooden wall - and some, gateways to the tree's inner caverns.  The hollowed out nooks show their age - the new with fresh tan woodchips sprinkled on the snow - and the old with a crust of hardened sap, dripping out their openings.  Doors, portals, windows - all could describe what a woodpecker makes here.  A trough for the bird, a home for the squirrel.
